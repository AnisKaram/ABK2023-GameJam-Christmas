Setup:

Enable Opaque and Depth texture on URP asset. 
Add 2 "Custom Clouds Fog" renderer features to your forward renderer asset.
Add "Clouds" material to settings of bottom one, add "Sky Volume" material to top.
Delete all directional lights from your scene.
Drag "DayNightPrefab" into your scene - remove "Sun_Rotator" script if you don't want a day/night cycle.
Navigate to lighting panel and set skybox material to "Starry Sky".

Details:

It is recommended to nto edit the sky material, or most properties of the cloud material. 
Parameters you may wish to change on the clouds for artistic reasons are "Colour", "Exposure", 
"MinDarkness", "Thickness", "Noise_Scale" and "Offset_Speed". Parameters you may wish to change
on the clouds for performance reasons are "Steps", "StepSize" and "LightingSteps". Lower "Steps" + higher "StepSize"
results in less realistic clouds with better performance and vice versa. Increasing "LightingSteps" results in better 
quality lighting, however, the increase reduces performance exponentially. These settings are already tuned for a balance 
in both performance and quality, however, some scenarios may require changes.
